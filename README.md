This is the course project. I made the Mood Tracker app where the user can create an account, add their daily mood and amount of sleep. User can view mood/sleep data via chart or popup window. User can read tips to feel mentally better via buttons that redirects user different websites. There are also development opportunity to later on to get notification and communinication with other users to work.

I used Android studio 4.1.2 versio to create the app. I recommend to use Pixel_3a_API_30_x86 as a running device.

To run the app:
Open Android Studio -> File -> New -> Project from Version Control ->choose Git (drop-down menu) > paste the link in the URL and choose your Directory > Click clone -> wait ->
Press start button.

Here is link how to run the android studio app: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-clone-android-project-from-github-in-android-studio/ if above did not work.
